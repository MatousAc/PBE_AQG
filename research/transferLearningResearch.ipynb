    "## Transfer Learning and Model Research\n",
    "### Deciding on an Approach\n",
    "Various approaches can be used for transfer learning. One of the first ideas to explore is how transfer learning itself is done. There are papers on this topic, such as In their paper on Transfer Learning [An Embarrassingly Simple Approach for Transfer Learning from Pretrained Language Models](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1902.10547)  that explain the core of transfer learning and also the parts that you can play around with. Below I explore how transfer learning is actually accomplished.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Similar Projects\n",
    "One way to get started is to check out other's projects. Here are several that seem quite similar to my goal:\n",
    "* [Simplifying Paragraph-level Question Generation via Transformer Language Models](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/transformer-based-end-to-end-question) uses GPT-2 Small as a base. Then trains on top and produces natural questions. This one is particularly good because it generates **extractive** questions and answers, which is exactly what PBE competitions are all about.\n",
    "* [Learning to Ask: Neural Question Generation for Reading Comprehension](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/learning-to-ask-neural-question-generation) is trained to ask questions. It avoids the rule-based approach and performs better on generating natural and complex questions than other approaches. This seems very promising.\n",
    "* [Neural Question Generation from Text: A Preliminary Study](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/neural-question-generation-from-text-a) uses [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) to generate \"fluent and diverse questions.\"\n",
    "* [Asking Questions the Human Way: Scalable Question-Answer Generation from Text Corpus](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/asking-questions-the-human-way-scalable) presents a seemingly successful question and answer generation project. However, running it looks difficult and there may be \"clues\" required to generate good questions.\n",
    "* [A BERT Baseline for Natural Questions](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/natural-questions) this paper uses a natural question dataset. Unfortunately, it seems more interested in answering questions rather than asking them.\n",
    "* [ChatDoctor](http://www.yunxiangli.top/ChatDoctor/). This AI was trained on 220K conversations between doctors and patients to learn to converse and follow instructions. It was built on the the back of the Large Language Model Meta AI (LlaMA).\n",
    "* [Generating Natural Questions About an Image](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/generating-natural-questions-about-an-image) is a very cool paper with a cool dataset. However, it is not what I need for text AQG.\n",
    "* [Unified Language Model Pre-training for Natural Language Understanding and Generation](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/unified-language-model-pre-training-for) claims to do question generation with the [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) database. Doesn't seem quite right though.\n",
    "* \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Promising datasets\n",
    "* [TriviaQA](http://nlp.cs.washington.edu/triviaqa/) has questions, answers, and usually, a context paragraph.\n",
    "* The Stanford Question Answering Dataset ([SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/)) contains questions, answers, and usually, a context paragraph. This data could be used in an \"inverted\" way to generate questions.\n",
    "* [harvestingQA](https://github.com/xinyadu/harvestingQA/tree/master/dataset) is a question-answer dataset in SQuAD format.\n",
    "* [SciQ](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/sciq) also contains questions, answers, and a supporting paragraph.\n",
    "* My own dataset of PBE questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Promising models\n",
    "* [potsawee/t5-large-generation-squad-QuestionAnswer](https://huggingface.co/potsawee/t5-large-generation-squad-QuestionAnswer) generates questions but is not ideal\n",
    "* [patil-suraj/question_generation](https://github.com/patil-suraj/question_generation) seems like a state-of-the-art model, but it will probably require some coercing to get the question and answers out of it.\n",
    "* [abhitopia/question-answer-generation](https://huggingface.co/abhitopia/question-answer-generation) looks like a good model, but requires question generation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other things I have checked out\n",
    "* [QuestGen](https://app.questgen.ai/) markets itself as a quiz question generator, but it **does not** generate good questions for PBE. The questions tend to be way too abstract for PBE competitions."
